  <p>In the Learning Lab, the Bok Center’s Media, Literacy and Visualization team (or MLV) works to support faculty projects involving many modes of communication, many media for expression, many audiences and registers.  In the Learning Lab Workshop Series, the MLV team (and select guests) will be offering members of Harvard’s teaching and learning community the opportunity to practice these new modes of communication and--just as crucially--to learn how they might engage their students in these media new and old, digital and physical.</p>
<p>Participants are invited to bring current projects or ideas for future projects (though this certainly isn’t required), and participation in the Learning Lab workshop entitles you to special access to the people, space, equipment, software, art supplies, and resources required to build a pilot or prototype in your chosen mode.  Want to create a video short about your research?  To design a podcasting assignment for your students?  Design and populate a website?  Develop resources to support a creative project you need to support in a class you’re TFing for next year?  We are your partners.</p>
  <h2>03.03 – HTML/CSS Crash Course</h2>
    <p>In this workshop, for which no previous coding experience is required, you'll learn to write in the basic language of the web. The workshop will be lead by Susan Buck from the Women's Coding Collective, https://thewc.co/ a development community dedicated to narrowing the gender gap in technology. </p>
  <h2>03.10 The Web for Non-Coders</h2>
  <p>While most of live a good portion of our lives on the web--seeing and interacting with the text, images and other media we find there, we don’t necessarily possess a grasp of what’s happening under the hood.  This workshop is less a tutorial on coding HTML, CSS and Javascript and more “code for reading knowledge.” How do the various languages that structure and styles websites and interaction work?  How can you learn to quickly tweak settings to achieve your design or pedagogical goal without having to code the whole thing yourself?</p>
  <h2>03.17 Principles of Graphic Design</h2>
  <p>Design has never been merely one problem among others for teachers, but, of course, when we do think of teaching and design, we are more typically thinking of instructional rather than graphic design.  But given the power of visual explanation as a teaching tool, perhaps this should change?  In this workshop, we will encounter the basic principles of graphic design, and we will think about practical applications rooted in the key moves that teachers and learners perform with ideas, texts, images, and data.<p>
  <h2>03.24 Pen, Brush, Chalk</h2>
  <p>(Drawing to Teach, Drawing to Learn)</p>
  <p>Much of the excitement surrounding visualization and visual teaching is driven by newly emergent technologies. But there are older technologies for visual communication that are every bit as powerful as digital tools.  Moreover, they are far better for rapidly and inexpensively prototyping and even delivering visual explanations.
